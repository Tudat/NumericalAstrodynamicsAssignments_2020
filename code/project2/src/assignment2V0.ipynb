    "# Assignment 2 - Interplanetary Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will use a Lambert targeter to generate a first guess for an unperturbed interplanetary transfer. Subsequently, you will use various numerical propagation models that include perturbations to analyze the trajectory in more detail, and compute trajectory corrections such that your trajectory meets its boundary conditions (departure and arrival) in the perturbed environment,\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are required to modify this Jupyter notebook. Unlike assignment 1, this assignment is in a single notebook, with the code for all questions and the assignment description all merged into a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use a so-called Lambert targeter (a tool that solves Lambert's problem) to generate an initial guess for an interplanetary direct high-thrust transfer. The Lambert targeter takes as input:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>A departure position $\\mathbf{r}_0$</li>\n",
    "    <li>An arrival position $\\mathbf{r}_E$</li>\n",
    "    <li>A time of flight $T$</li>\n",
    "    <li>A central body gravitational parameter $\\mu$</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambert targeter then generates the Keplerian trajectory between $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{E}$, with the given time of flight $T$. Since the initial and final positions uniquely define the trajectory (assuming a prograde single-revolution trajectory; ignoring rare singular cases), the full state along this Keplerian trajectory (or Lambert arc) are *outputs* of the Lambert targeter. We denote the Cartesian state function of this Lambert arc as $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t)$. For your situation, the initial and final position $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{E}$ of the full trajectory are the positions of the center of mass of Earth and Mars or Venus (w.r.t. the Sun), at times $t_{0}$ and $t_{E}$, respectively (with values depending on your student number, to be found in the $\\texttt{assignment2Input-2020-2021.txt}$ file on Brightspace under Assignment 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "All analysis on the output data can be done in the notebook. However, if you would like to use a different piece of software (*e.g.* Matlab) for your analyses, the relevant data is provided as output to data files, in a number of manners:\n",
    "\n",
    "* By calling the `propagate_trajectory` function, the propagated state of the spacecraft and the associated dependent variables will be saved to a file, as well as the state of the Lambert arc $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$ at the epochs of the numerical integration. See the in-code comments of the `write_propagation_results_to_file` function in the helper functions block code file for more details.\n",
    "* For question 3, the `write_propagation_results_to_file` function is called directly from the $\\texttt{main}$ function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before starting the assignment, read the submission instructions given at the end of this notebook.**\n",

    "We will now turn our attention to modifying the trajectory, so that we arrive at the desired target when *including* perturbations. When we modify an initial state $\\mathbf{x}_{0}$ or some parameter vector $\\mathbf{p}$ (which contains properties of the dynamical model), the propagated state $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ will change. When changing the initial state by $\\Delta \\mathbf{x}_{0}$ and/or a parameter vector by $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}$, we will denote the resulting change in numerically propagated state, as a function of time, as $\\Delta {\\mathbf{x}}(t)$.\n",

However, this can be a tedious and computationally expensive process.

Using the propagation settings of the previous question (case iii), the state and variational equations for the dynamics are propagated for each arc.

This will result in a discontinuous state history over the full transfer (since the propagation is performed in an arc-wise manner).
