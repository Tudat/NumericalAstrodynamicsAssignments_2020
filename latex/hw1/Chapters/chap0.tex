\section{Background}
\subsection{Graph Problems}
Graphical structure are widely used in computer science as they allow for a concise description of data. They also allow to transfer all the knowledge about graph theory to the computational domain. This in turn has lead to a considerable interest in solving graph problems, such as Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree, Vertex Cover and many more \citep{Shrinivas2010}.
